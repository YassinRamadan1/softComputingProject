# NFG-Library

A modular, object-oriented Java library implementing **Neural Networks**, **Fuzzy Logic**, and **Genetic Algorithms**, supported by real-world **case studies** demonstrating practical soft computing applications.

---

## 🧠 Overview

**NFG-Library** provides unified, reusable, and maintainable implementations of core soft computing techniques.  
The goal is to offer a clean API that allows developers, students, and researchers to integrate soft computing methods into different applications easily.

This repository also includes **case studies** (one per phase) that showcase how each technique can be applied to solve real-world problems.
